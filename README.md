# EAGLE-I Data Processor

## Overview
This project processes and aligns power outage data from the EAGLE-I dataset with ASOS weather data to enable advanced analysis of weather-driven outage events. The pipeline is designed for researchers and data analysts studying the relationship between weather conditions and power system resilience and reliability.

This repository contains scripts for:
- Cleaning and Preprocessing EAGLE-I Data, for any county
- Identifying Events in the EAGLE-I Data, for any county
- Downloading and Cleaning Weather Data, for any county
- Merging the EAGLE-I outage data and Weather data to form a single dataset, for any county
- Combine outage and weather data from multiple counties (of same state or different states) into a single dataset with county-level events grouped into larger multi-county events using a spatiotemporal grouping approach

## How to use - For single county analysis
### Initial Setup (First Time)

#### 1. Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd eagleiDataProcessor
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### 2. Prepare Data
- Ensure EAGLE-I CSV files are in `Eagle-idatasets/` folder
- The EAGLE-I files should follow pattern: `eaglei_outages_{YEAR}.csv`

#### 3. Update Configuration
Edit `config.json` with your analysis parameters:
```json
{
  "analysis_parameters": {
    "state": "YourState",
    "county": "YourCounty",
    "start_year": 2020,
    "end_year": 2024
  }
}
```

### Running the Pipeline

#### Option 1: Full Pipeline (Recommended for First Run)
```bash
python main.py --mode full --config config.json
```
This runs all 4 stages: fetch weather → clean weather → clean outage → align data

#### Option 2: Individual Stages
```bash
# Just fetch weather
python main.py --mode weather-only

# Just align data (if already have cleaned data)
python main.py --mode alignment-only

# Just process outages
python main.py --mode outage-only
```

#### Option 3: Override Configuration
Instead of updating the config file, you can specify the state, county, start year, and end year directly as arguments to the main function as shown below:
```bash
python main.py \
  --state "Florida" \
  --county "Miami-Dade" \
  --start-year 2020 \
  --end-year 2024
```
However, the config file provides a lot more options to change.

### Monitoring Progress

1. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/eaglei_dataprocessor.log
   ```

2. **Check configuration before running:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --show-config
   ```

3. **Enable debug logging:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --log-level DEBUG
   ```

## How to use - For multi-county analysis
As mentioned in the overview, the repo also offers the capabilities to combine data from individual counties together to form a larger dataset for multiple counties and even multiple states. Following is the step-by-step process to combine data for multiple-counties:
1. Run the full pipeline for each county (as explained above) to generate the merged outage and weather data files for each county.
2. Edit `config.json` file and mention the county names alongwith the corresponding state names for which you want to combine the data. Also add an optional (but recommended) "label" parameter to identify the result files:
    ```json
    {
      "multi_county_analysis_parameters": {
        "state_county_pairs": [
          {"state": "Illinois", "county": "Grundy"},
          {"state": "Illinois", "county": "Jersey"},
          {"state": "Illinois", "county": "Richland"},
          {"state": "Illinois", "county": "Whiteside"}
        ],
        "label": "Illinois_4_counties"
      }
    }
    ``` 
3. Run the code as follows the generate the multi-county data with the multi-county events identified in it:
    ```bash
      python main.py --mode multi-county
      ```
      Depending on the number of counties, the code takes a while to process all the data.  
      Once done, the result is stored in the `multi_county_data` directory.

**Note:** The multi-county grouping approach uses an adjacency graph of counties to identify which counties are neighbour of which counties based on both counties sharing some part of their geographic boundaries. There could some cases when you might want to consider two counties are neighbours even if they don't share a border with each other. Similarly there could be other cases where you might want to consider two counties as non-neighbouring counties even if they share border with each other. The `config.json` file provides additional options to handle these special cases, as shown below. These options needs to be specified before running the above code to make sure correct results are generated.
```json
{
  "county_adjacency_changes": {
    "add_edges": [
      {"from_state": "Massachusetts", "from_county": "Dukes", 
      "to_state": "Massachusetts", "to_county": "Barnstable"},
      {"from_state": "Massachusetts", "from_county": "Dukes", 
      "to_state": "Massachusetts", "to_county": "Nantucket"}
    ],
    "del_edges": [
      {"from_state": "Washington", "from_county": "Pierce", 
      "to_state": "Washington", "to_county": "Kittitas"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Workflow

The pipeline follows a 4-stage process for processing data for a single county:

### Stage 1: Fetch Weather Data
- Automatically retrieves ASOS weather data from IEM servers
- Stores data in parquet format for efficient processing
- Skipped if data already exists

### Stage 2: Clean Weather Data
- Interpolates missing values using forward fill
- Standardizes timestamps to 15-minute intervals
- Extracts key weather variables, as specified in the `config` file
- Save the data from all the weather stations in a county as a hierarchical NetCDF file

### Stage 3: Clean Outage Data
- Filters data for specified state and county
- Fills missing customer outage values
- Merges data across specified year range
- Extract events from the data
- Save the cleaned data in parquet formal

### Stage 4: Align and Merge
- Temporally aligns and merge the outage and weather datasets
- Stores the merged data in NetCDF format in the `merged_data` folder

## How the Events are defined and extracted from the EAGLE-I Data
- The Events in the EAGLE-I data are defined for each county separately. These are called the "county events".
- Once data cleaning is complete, the EAGLE-I data is sorted in ascending order by timestamp.
- The timeseries of `customers_out` and the timestamps in the EAGLE-I data are scanned, and whenever the `customers_out` value goes from less than the `events_customer_threshold` (defined in the config file) to **greater than or equal** to it, a new event is started.
- When the `customers_out` value goes back to **less than** the `events_customer_threshold`, the event is considered ended, and a unique event number is assigned to it.
- Once EAGLE-I event processing is completed, the EAGLE-I dataframe is returned with an events_number column appended.
- **Note**: The event column contains unique event numbers assigned to the events defined as explained above, but the rest of the data (between two consecutive events) also remains in the dataset, with different event numbers assigned to it. That data is kept for further analysis of timestamps that don't fall under the events defined above. Those values can be easily excluded by grouping the dataframe by the events column and selecting events with a minimum value of `customers_out` equal to or greater than the `events_customer_threshold`.
